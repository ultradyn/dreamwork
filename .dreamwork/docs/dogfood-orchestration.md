# Dogfood record — coordinator-only loop, and which runner to use

Two questions the human wants answered by evidence, not impression (2026-07-28
05:10). This file is the running record; it is a **measurement log, not a
conclusion**, and every row states how it was measured.

1. **Which models/providers are best for us**, per kind of task.
2. **Does the dreamwork loop work with the main session as coordinator only** —
   dispatching every increment — rather than doing the work itself?

And a third, added at 05:13: **does a c2c peer outperform a subagent handed a
task**, ideally on a measurable criterion. Recorded in its own section.

## The success criterion, fixed in advance

Both live lanes are guard work, which is unusually well suited to measurement
because the guard's own verdict is the criterion and it is not a matter of taste:

- **Primary**: does the named guard end **green**, run in isolation, on its
  assigned port?
- **Secondary, and it can fail while the primary passes** — which is the whole
  point of this repo's rules: was the **red-proof real**? The agent must name what
  it broke, the exact check that failed, and the production line that would have to
  change for its check to fail. A guard turned green by widening a tolerance until
  it cannot fail scores **worse than red**.
- **Discipline**: did it stay inside its stated file ownership? (`watch.py` was
  off-limits to both; a third agent holds it.)
- **Cost**: wall-clock from dispatch to report.

Written down before the results so the bar cannot move afterwards.

## Runner routing — what actually works

| alias | route | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `@grok` | grok CLI, `grok-4.5` | **works** |
| `@glm52` | grok CLI + `provider=llmp`, `glm-5.2` | **BROKEN — cannot work** |
| `@oc-glm52` | opencode + `zai-coding-plan`, `glm-5.2` | **works** (smoke-tested) |
| `@pi-glm52` | pi + `llmp`, `glm-5.2` | untested |

**`@glm52` cannot reach glm-5.2 and it is not an environment problem.** Measured:

- `grok models` → `You are logged in with grok.com. Default model: grok-4.5.
  Available models: * grok-4.5 (default)`. That is the whole list.
- The failure is `Couldn't set model 'glm-5.2': Invalid params: "unknown model id"`.
- It fails **identically under a `fish -l -c` login shell**, so the missing-fish-env
  hypothesis is refuted — the alias's `provider = "llmp"` is not reaching the grok
  runner, or that runner does not support a custom provider at all.
- `@gk-glm52` has the same shape and will fail the same way.

So glm-5.2 is reachable, but through **opencode or pi, not through the grok CLI**.
Either the `glm52` alias should become `runner = "opencode"` with
`provider = "zai-coding-plan"` (i.e. a copy of `oc-glm52`), or the grok runner needs
whatever makes `llmp` reachable. That is the human's config to change, not mine.

## Live lanes

| lane | runner | task | dispatched | criterion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | `@oc-glm52` | `#382` — `plugcmd`'s fixed-900ms race (`dev/capture/plugcmd.mjs`, port 39897) | 05:12 | plugcmd green + real red-proof |
| B | `@grok` | `#383` — three motion guards that disagree with themselves (`revieworder`, `gitrow`, `burndown`, port 39895) | 05:11 | characterisation table first; then green + real red-proof, or an honest "still flaky" |

Both briefs were written to `.dreamwork/docs/briefs/` and the agent was pointed at
the file rather than handed the prompt inline — so the brief is reviewable,
re-runnable, and comparable between runners. Both were told: never use `attn`,
append once to `.dreamwork/inbox.md`, stage by explicit path, do not push, and
`watch.py` is off-limits.

Lane A cost one false start: dispatched to `@glm52` at 05:10, which died in ~2
seconds on the model error above. **That is itself a result** — a misconfigured
alias fails fast and loudly, which is the good case.

## c2c peer versus dispatched subagent

The comparison is available because both exist in this tree right now:

- **c2c peer** (`grok`, its own session, `.worktrees/277-dreamfade`): #277's
  departure dreamfade. Long-lived, holds its own port, chooses its own increments,
  and I coordinate it by asking rather than instructing. Cost observed so far: it
  held `:35277` across two requests to release it, and its work sat uncommitted for
  hours where I could not see it — I only learned what it was doing by reading its
  worktree diff. Benefit: it is genuinely autonomous and needs no brief.
- **Dispatched subagent** (`ccc`, lanes A and B): scoped by a brief, owns named
  files, reports to a known path, terminates. Cost: the brief took real effort to
  write, and a bad brief is my fault rather than theirs. Benefit: ownership is
  explicit, so lanes are provably disjoint, and the report arrives where I look.

**Open, and the honest state**: no measurable comparison yet, because the peer's
task and the subagents' tasks are not comparable work. The clean experiment is to
give a peer and a subagent the *same* brief with the same criterion, and that has
not been run.
