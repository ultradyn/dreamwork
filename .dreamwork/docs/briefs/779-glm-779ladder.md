# BRIEF — #779: the ladder's bottom rung returns silently instead of naming what it could not classify

**Task:** `python3 dev/ledger.py get 779 --ledger /home/xertrov/.llm-general/skills/ud-dreamwork/.dreamwork/tasks.md` — read the entry and its notes, including the scoping pre-check I already answered.

## This is a latent gap, not a live defect — keep it that size

Found by lane `cx-776cite2` while routing `dispatch_lane.py`'s ledger read through the sanctioned
door. **Nothing is broken today**: `dispatch_lane` degrades safely, reporting `ledger reference
check DID NOT RUN` and still launching, and it does so without a second database door. P3 reflects
that. Do not turn this into a refactor of the ladder.

## The scoping pre-check the entry asks for is already answered — twice

The entry says: *check whether any CURRENT caller catches `SchemaMismatch`; if none does, this is
documentation-plus-a-test rather than a behaviour change, and it should be scoped that way.*

**Measured at `e195f901`, then RE-MEASURED at this base after #645 i9 landed new
`dreamwork_db/questions.py` and `reviews.py`:** the only `except SchemaMismatch` in production is
`dreamwork_db/migrate.py:59`, inside the migration machinery itself. Nothing outside catches it.
Tests reference it only in `test_dreamwork_db_migrate.py`.

So: **small and surgical.** But read the consequence the other way too, because it cuts both ways —
*nothing catches it* also means changing the behaviour has **zero blast radius today**, and that is
the cheapest this fix will ever be. Weigh both readings and say which you took and why.

## What I found, so you can start from the mechanism rather than the symptom

`dreamwork_db/core.py:250`:

```python
def _raise_busy(exc: sqlite3.OperationalError, *, operation: str) -> None:
    busy_codes = {sqlite3.SQLITE_BUSY, sqlite3.SQLITE_LOCKED}
    code = getattr(exc, "sqlite_errorcode", None)
    if code in busy_codes or "locked" in str(exc).lower() or "busy" in str(exc).lower():
        raise Busy(f"database busy during {operation}: {exc}") from exc
```

**It is a partial classifier that RETURNS SILENTLY when it cannot classify.** Its callers
(`core.py:154`, `:166`, `:188`, `:200`) catch `sqlite3.OperationalError`, call it, and when it
declines the raw sqlite error propagates untouched. That is how the lane saw a bare
`no such column: state` escape a ladder whose whole purpose is that callers never see raw sqlite.

**Verify this yourself before changing anything** — construct a store with the wrong shape, read it
through `core`, and observe what actually escapes. My reading of the code is a lead, not a finding.

## The shape of the fix, and the trap inside it

`core` is the single sanctioned connection route (#440), so every caller inherits this ladder. The
defect is not "SchemaMismatch is missing" — it is that **an unclassifiable store state leaves the
ladder unnamed**, which is #702 at this seam.

The obvious patch is to add a `no such column` / `no such table` branch raising `SchemaMismatch`.
That is probably right, but on its own it **moves the silent-fallthrough one step down** rather
than closing it: the next unclassifiable `OperationalError` escapes exactly as before, and now with
more confidence behind it.

So the thing actually worth landing is that **nothing escapes unnamed**. An `OperationalError`
`core` cannot classify should surface as a named `DatabaseError` that says it is unclassified and
carries the original — not raw, and emphatically **not** relabelled `SchemaMismatch` on the way past
(#651: a name must not imply more than it proves; a caller that catches `SchemaMismatch` and gets a
disk-IO error has been lied to).

**What you must not lose:** `Busy` behaviour is unchanged. A locked store must still raise `Busy`,
because `dispatch_lane`'s degraded path depends on it and that path runs immediately before
`os.execvp` on the loop's only dispatch route. A change that turns a locked store into anything
else breaks the loop's ability to launch lanes at all (#755).

## Red-proof

- **Direction 1:** construct a store whose schema is genuinely wrong (drop or rename a column the
  read needs), read it through `core`, and show the ladder now names it. Then break your
  classification and watch the test red naming the specific case — the discriminating failure is
  the wrong *class*, not merely an exception.
- **Direction 2 (the one that protects the loop):** prove a **locked** store still raises `Busy`
  and still reaches `dispatch_lane`'s `DID NOT RUN` degraded path, launching rather than refusing.
  A ladder change that silently starts refusing launches would be far worse than the gap you are
  closing.
- **Direction 2b:** prove an `OperationalError` that is neither busy nor schema-shaped becomes the
  named unclassified error and is **not** mislabelled `SchemaMismatch`.

- Run `python3 dev/redproof.py` for the snapshot/restore protocol — it owns it and subsumes
  `dev/lane_scratch.py`. Run `python3 dev/lessons_index.py --act red-proof` before any injection.
- **Never `git checkout` to restore an injection** (#349). Snapshot the FIXED file, not the pre-fix
  one (#608).

## Lessons selected for this task

- **#702 — report what you cannot classify.** The whole task, in one line.
- **#651 — a name must not imply more than it proves.** Why blanket-relabelling as
  `SchemaMismatch` is worse than the raw error.
- **#440 — one supported way.** `core` is the single door, so every caller inherits this ladder.
- **#755 — a check that fires on a healthy input is worse than no check.** The locked-store path
  must keep launching.
- **#707 — every widening multiplies false attribution.** Do not grow the ladder's surface beyond
  naming the unclassified case.

## Run these, explicitly

```
just pytest test_dreamwork_db_core.py test_dreamwork_db_migrate.py test_dispatch_lane.py
just pytest $(python3 dev/repo_wide_guards.py list)
```

`test_dispatch_lane.py` is there because it owns the degraded path your change could break, and no
owned-files list would point you at it. The second line is the always-run repo-wide set #778 landed
today; the boilerplate below names it. `test_no_raw_connect.py` is in that set and governs your file
directly.

## Bars

**Measured at this gated base, 2026-08-01:** main-checkout lint **18 warnings**; full tree **2713
passed**. Your worktree bar will be higher — a fresh worktree carries rows the main checkout does
not. Re-measure and quote what *you* got.

- Count tests by collecting, not by grepping `def test_`.
- **Two other lanes are live.** `cx-781guards` owns `dev/capture/*` and `client/` and is binding the
  guard ports — do not run browser guards. `cx-777i3` owns `.dreamwork/docs/**/*.md` and `lint.py`.
- Limit builds and tests to 2 threads.
- Do not bind `:35110` or `:35113`.
- Rebase onto master before you finish and resolve conflicts yourself.
- Do not use `attn`.

# Lane brief boilerplate — appended verbatim to every dispatch

This is the standing half of a lane brief. The coordinator writes a task-specific head
and concatenates this file after it. It lives in the repo rather than in a session
scratchpad because it is corrected by lane dogfood reports several times a night, and
every one of those corrections used to die with the session that made it (`#703`).

**Corrections belong here.** When a lane reports that a rule was wrong, missing, or
unreachable, fix it in this file in the same increment that acts on the report. The duty
runs both ways: when `SKILL.md` gains a lane-facing rule, reflect it here too — a rule
stranded in the coordinator's doc never reaches a lane (`#400`), and no string-match check
can bind "a rule is stated" (a token is not a statement, `#699`), so this rotation carries it.

## Standing rules — these bind you, and this loop has been burned by every one

**Authority and contradictions.** A task-specific instruction overrides this standing
contract only when it says explicitly that it is an override and names the rule it replaces.
An unannounced disagreement is a brief defect: follow this standing contract and report the
conflict in your DOGFOOD REPORT. If two instructions inside the task-specific head disagree,
do not guess which one the coordinator meant. Do only what both readings authorise; when the
disagreement controls whether a deliverable should exist, measure first and build it only if
both readings authorise the build. Report the contradiction plainly. This rule chooses a safe
lane action after a defective dispatch; it does not make the contradictory brief correct.

**Base state.** You branched from the tip of local `master` **at dispatch time**. Do not trust
any literal sha in a brief as current — master moves while you work, and a lane rebasing an
hour later found master three commits past the sha its brief named. Read it yourself:
`git rev-parse master`. (Never a commit count either: a count rots into a comforting number —
a `#655` brief said "one commit ahead" when it was 32 behind, and the merge ERRORed exactly
as that hid.)

**When this brief names a defect site, treat it as an EXAMPLE, not the inventory.** Before
declaring the fix done, check the sibling constructs in the same unit — the same object, the
same function, the same string. On `#690` the brief named one backticked path in a two-line
body; the *same body* backticked a second token, and fixing only the named one left the bug
alive while still passing a naive string assertion. The lane caught it only by extending the
check on its own initiative. Extend it on yours.

**Read resulting state before relying on a command.** After a command mutates state or supplies
an inventory that controls the next action, immediately read the authoritative result: merge
ancestry/HEAD, the stored ledger entry, the worktree list, or the complete target population.
Bind any success report or follow-on write to the producing command's status, not to a later
pipeline element or whatever state was already present. A plausible command spelling is not
evidence that its intended behaviour occurred.

**DO NOT WRITE TO `.dreamwork/handoffs.md` — specifically, do not append any hand-off line
there. That file has a single writer and it is not you** (the lesson *"Both wordings of the hand-off instruction are wrong, and I
found the second by hitting it twice"*, and `#687`). It is an ownership rule reached after the
alternatives were tried and failed twice in twenty minutes: a lane appending to `## Pending`
while the coordinator edits `## Folded` produces a content conflict on *every* merge. **You
write your completion report to the coordinator inbox named in the task-specific head and
nothing to `.dreamwork/handoffs.md`; the coordinator writes the hand-off line from your report at
merge.** (SKILL.md briefly said otherwise; `#687` reconciled it at `dc3ac7c3`, so the two now
agree and neither needs to be believed over the other.)

**Rebase before you report, in that order.** Master moves while you work. Before writing the
sha into your report, rebase onto **the LOCAL `master` branch — not `origin/master`, which is
behind it** (a lane that read "master" as `origin/master` replayed 832 commits into a conflict;
check with `git rev-parse master` vs `origin/master`), and resolve conflicts *here*, with your
context —
the coordinator resolving them blind is how `#667` went wrong. Order matters: **a rebase
rewrites shas**, so a sha captured first names a commit that no longer exists.
Append-only files (`.dreamwork/handoffs.md`, `.dreamwork/lessons.md`) conflict at EOF and
keep-both is nearly always right. After ANY hand resolution, grep line-anchored for all four
diff3 forms:

    grep -nE '^(<{7}|>{7}|\|{7}|={7}$)'

Note the `$`, which only the `=` arm carries and which is load-bearing: the other three
markers are followed by a branch or base name so they cannot be anchored, while `=======`
stands alone — and an unanchored `={7}` matches any rule-of-equals divider of seven or more
characters, which false-positives on this repo's own prose and test files. This repo
discusses conflict markers in prose (the lesson *"A conflict resolver that greps for three
marker forms misses the fourth"*), so a substring test is
wrong by construction.

If the rebase is genuinely hard, **hand back the analysis instead of a bad resolution** —
that is a legitimate outcome, not a failure.

**Red-proof both directions. This is the one that catches real defects.**
- *Direction 1*: inject the real defect and watch your check go red **on the discriminating
  failure message** — not on a red count. A red for the wrong reason is indistinguishable
  from a right one in a `-q` summary.
  **Use `dev/redproof.py`; it owns the snapshot/restore protocol** (`#683`):

      python3 dev/redproof.py begin <path>     # snapshot the file as-is, arm the entry
      …sabotage it, run your check, watch it go red…
      python3 dev/redproof.py restore <path>   # record the injected content, restore, verify
      python3 dev/redproof.py check            # hand-off gate — run before you report, quote it

  **The snapshot is of the file BEFORE sabotage; the real fix is applied AFTER
  `restore` returns it — so the restore can never undo the fix.** If you snapshot
  the pre-fix file and the fix is already in it, restore returns the fixed file;
  if you ever snapshot the pre-fix file and then restore expecting the fix, you
  have silently undone your own work and `cmp` will certify the wrong file (`#608`).

  **Run `check` before reporting and quote its output.** It REFUSES if any injection is left
  unrestored, which is the failure nothing could previously detect: an injection is by
  construction a small plausible edit to real code, so a lane that gets absorbed in writing its
  report and commits has shipped a deliberate defect with a green-looking report attached.
  It also fails closed — an unreadable registry or a missing snapshot is a fault at exit 2, not
  a pass — and distinguishes that from the calm zero of nothing registered (`#136`, `#671`).

  **Keep committing while sabotaged — that rule is unchanged — and let `check` catch what it
  costs.** A clean tree is not a clean branch: `check` also scans every commit this branch adds
  to its base and refuses if one still holds the recorded injection (`#710`), because a merge
  makes that defect reachable from master forever. If it refuses, say so in your report and name
  the commit: the fix is for the coordinator to **squash this one branch** at merge, not for you
  to have committed less. This is a tool that will refuse you, not a rule you have to remember.

  Using the tool also discharges two rules you would otherwise have to remember. It places
  snapshots **lane-privately** (`#652`: the session scratchpad is shared by every live lane, and
  `#703` records a lane's first snapshot landing in a directory already holding another lane's backups of
  `watch.py`, `router.js` and `test_watch.py` — two lanes clobbering each other's restore point
  is the exact failure snapshots exist to prevent), on `~/.cache` (btrfs) rather than `/tmp`
  (tmpfs, the substrate half of `#634`). And because `begin` snapshots at the moment you arm each
  injection, it cannot snapshot a file before later edits and then silently lose them on restore.
  **Never `git checkout` to restore an injection** (`#349`, a repeat offence here); `restore`
  copies from the snapshot and verifies.
- *Direction 2*: construct an input where the thing you are checking is **genuinely broken
  but your check still passes**. Report it even if you cannot close it. If none can be
  constructed, say why not. One-directional red-proofing is exactly what let three
  false-greens through on `#596` and three more on `#655`.

**A guard or test named as evidence must name the assertion that would fail.** On `#655` a
guard was reported PASS as evidence with no assertion about the feature at all and no journal
in its fixture — its PASS was guaranteed before the work started. If you cite a check, say
what it would catch.

**Every issue number you cite must be opened and read**, with the relied-on line quoted into
your report. Confidently-wrong citations are the characteristic failure mode here. **The bare
`dev/ledger.py get <id>` form REFUSES from a worktree** — the store is gitignored so it cannot
travel. Use this exact invocation:

    python3 dev/ledger.py get <id> --ledger /home/xertrov/.llm-general/skills/ud-dreamwork/.dreamwork/tasks.md

(The refusal does name the working form, so this costs one wasted call rather than a wrong
citation — `#667` built that gate deliberately. This just saves you the call.)

**Cite a lesson by its exact bolded title, not by `lessons.md:<line>`.** Confirm the title
resolves to exactly one lesson head with `grep`; zero matches means it drifted, and two matches
are ambiguous. A line coordinate can silently move to unrelated content while looking valid.

**The path you invoke is the INTERPRETER; `--target`/`--ledger` is only the SUBJECT.** A
brief head may cite a tool by its skill-dir path
(`python3 /home/…/skills/ud-dreamwork/<tool>.py`) — that is a symlink into the MAIN
checkout, so it runs the code you have NOT fixed. If your task edits a tool the brief tells
you to run, invoke the WORKTREE'S copy (`python3 dev/<tool>.py`), which runs your fix. The
one legitimate use of the skill-dir path is the pre-fix BASELINE — running the unfixed tool
deliberately to capture the before state (`#592`, `#607`). That is a technique, not a
mistake; a rule that bans the skill-dir path would forbid it.

**Volume**: land your change as the fewest lines that carry the meaning. A correct
change that triples a doc's length gets reverted by the next reader.

**Shipping an experiment?** Its gate is a file: its own tracked `.dreamwork/<name>`, absent
means off, plus a `file-formats.md` row — the `watch-tint`/`run-mode` family. Do not go
looking for a flag system; `#700` measured that there is none and `SKILL.md`'s Guardrails
now carries the rule.

**Choosing between rival options?** Use IGC — `./igc-method.md`, **in your own worktree**. It
is checked into this repo, so the worktree-local path always resolves; do not go looking under
`~/.claude-p/` (a `ccc` lane reported that path unreachable from its harness).

**Mechanics.** `git commit --only <paths>` — **never `git commit -a`**. Run `git add -N` for
new files first so `--only` can see them. **Never merge, never push** — the coordinator does
both. Never use bare `git stash`/`git stash pop`: the stash stack is shared across worktrees
and you would pop another lane's work. `--only` stops you sweeping OTHER files from the index,
but it commits the path's **full current content** — so if another agent has an uncommitted
edit to the **same** file, your `--only` sweeps their edit too (`#624`). That agent's own
`--only` then reports `nothing to commit, working tree clean`, which reads as failure but
means "your write was already committed by someone else." **If you see `nothing to commit`
after writing to a file, CHECK whether your content is already on master (`grep` for your
line) before re-appending — re-appending creates a DUPLICATE the coordinator folds twice.**
(For `.dreamwork/handoffs.md` specifically this is moot: you do not write it, `#687` made the
coordinator its single writer. The rule is for any other shared file.)

**Name the task id in every commit subject, in the form `verb(#NNN): <subject>`** — e.g.
`feat(#577):`, `test(#577):`, `fix(#688):`, `docs(#700):`. The verb must be one of
`merge fix feat close perf refactor guard docs test design`.

**The form is not cosmetic and `#NNN: <subject>` DOES NOT WORK.** `dev/ledger.py sweep` is how
the coordinator learns your work landed, and `#404` makes it the primary landing-discovery
route on the grounds the id is in the subject "by construction". Its pattern is
`^(?:merge|fix|…|design)\((#\d+)\)` — anchored, and it requires the parens. Measured:
`'#704: skip the collision test'` → **MISSED**; `'design(#700): the gate is a file'` → matched.
So a subject that names the id in the wrong shape is exactly as invisible as one that omits it,
and it is worse, because it *looks* compliant. This paragraph said `#NNN:` for about half an
hour on 2026-07-31 and was wrong; a `#700` lane measured it against the actual regex and
reported it (`#707` tracks widening the pattern, which is the better long-run fix — until then,
write the form the tool can read).

**COMMIT INCREMENTALLY. You can be killed without warning, and uncommitted work is lost.**
This is not the `#686` rule ("commit before you stop") — it is stronger, because stopping is
not always your decision. Four lanes were terminated mid-flight on 2026-07-31 with no error in
any log; one had finished its measurements, chosen its design, and written the change, and had
committed nothing. Its diff survived only because the coordinator salvaged it from the
worktree by hand before removing it. **The moment you have something coherent — a measurement
worth keeping, a working change, even a partial one — commit it.** A commit that says "WIP:
measured X, Y still open" is a result. An uncommitted worktree is a coin flip. Amend or add
commits freely afterwards; the coordinator squashes nothing and reads your history.

**Commit the deliverable, not just the code.** The inbox is not lossless (`#404`/`#392a`
landed work whose report never arrived), so whatever must survive — an audit, an analysis, a
design doc — goes into the commit, and the inbox report carries the richer context. A lane
cannot land work without committing; that is the one channel that cannot be skipped.

**Do NOT touch `:35110` (the live dashboard) or `:35113` (dev).** Bind ephemeral ports only.
Limit builds and tests to **2 threads**.

**Do NOT use `attn`.** You report to the coordinator; the coordinator decides whether to ping
the human. This is absolute.

**Run a targeted subset, not the whole tree — the coordinator owns the single full merged-tree
sweep.** `just pytest <the test files your change touches>` is your verification; the merge gate
already re-proves the whole tree once, so N lanes each re-proving it is N−1 wasted suites under
exactly the load this loop has measured (`#666`). Name the files you ran. **This is
resource-aware, not just wall-clock-aware**: the scarce resource is resident memory, not CPU —
measured, the fleet was 8.5% of CPU on a ~70%-idle machine while swap sat at 52 GB of 60. So a
non-UI lane (docs, tooling, ledger work) can run concurrently with a guard sweep; a
browser-binding lane cannot, because one Chromium costs more than several pytest lanes together.
**A task-specific request for a bare full-suite run is therefore ignored unless it explicitly
names this rule and says why it is overriding it.**
The recipe first prints how many other suites and browser processes are live, so you can see
which situation you are in before adding your own load.

**Also run the always-run repo-wide guard set — additive to the targeted subset above, not a
replacement for it.** A repo-wide guard asserts a property over a population your diff cannot
enumerate (every production source, every parser verb), so "the tests for the files you touched"
cannot reach it — two merges were reverted in one hour for exactly this (`#776`'s lane added a raw
`sqlite3.connect`; `#645` i9 added verbs with no `_VERB_ARGV` rows). The ruling above stands
unchanged: this is a small, deliberate ~1%-of-the-tree set ON TOP of your targeted subset, not the
whole tree. Run it alongside your subset:

    just pytest $(python3 dev/repo_wide_guards.py list)

`python3 dev/repo_wide_guards.py list` is the single source for the set (`#440`); today it holds
`test_no_raw_connect.py::test_no_raw_sqlite_connect_in_production_sources` and
`test_ledger_cli.py::test_the_map_covers_every_verb` (37 tests, ~0.4s). This catches cross-cutting
RULES only — not a lane breaking an unrelated feature's behaviour, which is what the coordinator's
full merged-tree sweep is for and remains for (`#651`); nothing here makes that sweep optional.
Adding a member needs the entry criterion argued (see the tool's docstring).

**Lane bars are command-, snapshot-, and interpreter-relative.** Run `python3 lint.py`: require
NO ERRORs and inspect every WARN message against the measured baseline. A worktree may add
`tasks.md` ledger-absent/zero-entry, `status.json`-absent, and `ledger checks`-examined-nothing
WARNs because those artifacts do not travel. To inspect live data with the WORKTREE interpreter,
use `python3 lint.py --target /home/xertrov/.llm-general/skills/ud-dreamwork`; a stale interpreter
need not reproduce current output.

When a brief asks for real-path parity, freeze the subject (a read-only backup, copied fixture,
or pinned revision) and pin the baseline interpreter revision; vary only the intended interpreter
change. Report raw live readings as context, not as the proof. Otherwise concurrent movement can
make an honest "not identical" look like the lane's regression — or tempt it to round the
difference off to satisfy an impossible brief.

Likewise, judge targeted pytest by its own before/after collected count; a whole-repo total quoted
in a moving brief head is not that run's bar.

**Filesystem measurements need a measured substrate and an exact positive control.** Use
`M="$(dev/lane_scratch.py measure)"` as the one lane-private location; ask the kernel for its
filesystem type (`stat -f` / `findmnt`), never infer it from `/tmp`, the repo, or any path prefix.
Before believing a negative mtime result, set up a subject under `$M` and run
`dev/lane_scratch.py require-mtime-change "$M/<subject>" -- <the positive-control command>` with
the **same mmap/write mechanism** as the real probe. Success is silent; `UNSUPPORTED` means the
control ran without advancing mtime, and `UNDETERMINED` means it did not judge. A `touch` control
does not validate an mmap probe, and non-mtime phenomena need their own positive control.

**Verification gate.** `just test` runs pytest + `lint.py` + browser guards. **Do not run the
full `just guards`** — several lanes are live, and a *multi-server* browser guard under high
load returns a WRONG answer rather than a slow one (it dies before judging: `"the guard threw
before finishing its checks"`, the `#471` did-not-judge sentinel, which gates nothing but
reads like a failure). Run only the specific guards your change bears on, say which, and
quote the load figure each one prints.

**Measured load figures, so you do not have to guess a threshold.** The failures were at load
**38-42** (`health`, which spawns four servers at once). Single guards judged correctly at
**22.79**, and `health` itself ran clean end-to-end at **23.72** — all 20 assertions PASS.
So load in the low-to-mid 20s is fine; do not refuse to run on that. A `#690` lane declined
at 21-25 against an over-cautious threshold and handed back a diagnosis with its headline
evidence missing, which the coordinator then had to produce at the gate.

**But know what that number is.** Linux load average counts uninterruptible-sleep processes,
so it conflates *blocked on swap-in* with *running* — the coordinator quoted it three times as
evidence of CPU contention when the machine was ~70% CPU idle and the real constraint was
memory (`#666`, third note). The thresholds above are still the right empirical guide, because
they were measured against the same conflated figure. Just do not reason from load to "the CPU
is busy": if you need the cause rather than the reading, decompose it before attributing.

**A single-process static probe is explicitly authorised at any load** — one Chromium, no
motion, no server fleet. It is load-invariant and is NOT what the paragraph above restricts.
If the real guard is genuinely out of reach, reproducing its exact assertion in a one-process
probe is a legitimate and useful substitute; say that is what you did.

## Deliverable

Report to the coordinator with: the verdict; what you changed and why; **both directions of
every red-proof**, with the discriminating message quoted for direction 1 and the open
false-green named for direction 2; every cited issue with its relied-on line quoted; the
rebase outcome; and anything you found that was out of scope (do not fix it — name it, and
the coordinator files it).

Then a **DOGFOOD REPORT** — required, not optional (#589): what about this
loop's own tooling, docs, or briefs cost you time or misled you? My briefs have
been wrong several times today and the lanes that said so were right. The
section's value is what you found **beyond** your direct task — a premise the
brief got wrong, a hazard a sibling construct hides, friction with a tool, an
out-of-scope warning. Tonight's highest-value findings across seven lanes were
exactly those, and one — a predicted merge break — sat unread in an out-of-scope
section the coordinator never looked at, so write the section **and** know the
coordinator reads it. **"No friction found" is a valid answer that is STATED**;
an omitted section is not, because it reads as "no friction" and is
indistinguishable from a lane that did not look (#136/#671).
