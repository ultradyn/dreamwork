# File formats — what the loop writes, and what reads it back

Some files under `.dreamwork/` are written by the loop in prose and read
back by a tool. For those, "what the file means" is not enough: the
reader has a shape it requires, and a file that misses it fails
**silently**, because zero parsed entries is indistinguishable from
nothing to report.

That is not hypothetical. On 2026-07-25 a dreamwork instance on another
project opened its dashboard to zero questions over a `questions.md`
holding six, four of them genuinely open and two of those privacy
defaults. The loop had written `##` headings *as* the questions. Nothing
told it otherwise, because the only specification of the format lived in
the parser.

**Rule: if you write a file something else parses, write it in the shape
below. If the shape is not stated below, say so rather than inventing
one — an invented shape that looks right is exactly how this fails.**

## `.dreamwork/questions.md`

Read by `watch.py` for `/questions`, the open-question badge, and the
`/answer` and `/comment` write paths. The single most important format
in the loop, because it is the channel to the human.

```markdown
# Questions for the human

## Open

- **2026-07-25 — a question, whose bold title may hard-wrap across
  source lines and closes its `**` wherever that falls.** The body is
  indented prose. Backticked paths like `.dreamwork/review/x.html`
  become links.
  - **Note (human, via watch, 2026-07-25 09:00):** a threaded note.
    Continuation lines belong to the note, not the body.
  - **Follow-up (loop, 2026-07-25 09:01):** one from the loop.
  - **Answer (via watch, 2026-07-25 09:02):** answered from the page,
    awaiting the loop's fold.

## Answered

- **A folded question.** → resolved (2026-07-25): the resolution head
  comes first in the body, and `answered_at()` reads only that.
```

Load-bearing details, each of which was a bug at some point:

- **The section headings are literal.** The reader matches
  `line.strip() == "## Open"` and `== "## Answered"` exactly. No other
  line opens a section — this is what the other project got wrong.
- **A top-level `- **` always starts a new entry**, and nothing can
  absorb it: not an unterminated title, not an open sub-bullet.
- **Titles may hard-wrap.** The loop writes at ~72 columns, so a title
  running onto the next line is normal input, not malformed.
- **Sub-bullets may hard-wrap too**, and their continuation lines belong
  to the bullet rather than the body.
- **Author tags are a closed set**, and the page renders them
  differently: `(human, via <channel>, <ts>)` and `(loop, <ts>)` are the
  current forms; `(via watch…)` reads as human and `(in-session…)` as
  loop, kept for entries written before the tags existed.

Canonical, exercised example — every shape above appears in it:
`dev/capture/fixture/.dreamwork/questions.md`. Read that before
inventing anything.

## The rest

These are written by the loop and read by something. Their contracts are
**not yet stated here**, which is a known gap tracked as #137 — until
they are, follow the shape of what is already in the file rather than
restructuring it, and prefer appending to an existing skeleton.

| File | Read by | Contract stated? |
|---|---|---|
| `.dreamwork/status.json` | `watch.py`'s status reader; the dashboard's status section | No — a schema, not a shape. Match the existing keys |
| `.dreamwork/tasks.md` | humans today; the dashboard once #98 lands | No — one `- **#N**` entry per task, `Next id:` in the header |
| `.dreamwork/lessons.md` | humans; grooming | No — genuinely one line per lesson |
| `.dreamwork/dreams/<date>-<time>-<slug>.md` | the coordinator; grooming | The **filename** is the contract: `2026-07-25-1130-slug.md` |
| `.dreamwork/skill-version` | init's update check | One line: the latest applied `migrations/` filename |
| `DREAMWORK.md` | the loop, the wizard, the scope gate | No — section headings are load-bearing |

## Why this file exists rather than a paragraph in SKILL.md

SKILL.md says what each file *means* and when to write it. That is the
right thing for it to say, and it is what made the failure possible: a
loop can follow every semantic instruction perfectly and still produce
something the reader cannot see. The shape lives here so there is one
place to correct when a reader changes.

The intended end state is that this file stops being the enforcement and
becomes the explanation — a linter that calls the actual readers is the
enforcement, because a checker cannot drift from itself the way a third
description can (#137).
